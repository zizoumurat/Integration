1 - Network Problems:
	In distributed systems, there can be network issues. If communication with a Redis server is lost or delayed while using RedLock, unexpected situations may arise.
	Therefore, it is important to ensure the reliability of your network connections
2 - The Redis server may crash.
	In such a scenario, data loss and the inability to store new data can occur.
3 - Time Sensitivity:
	RedLock waits for a certain period to acquire a lock.
	However, this expected duration does not imply that processes will consistently occur at the same speed
4 - Server Synchronization:
	RedLock assumes that time is synchronized among Redis servers.
	If there are time differences between servers, the reliability of RedLock may decrease.
